Medical Image Segmentation plays a key role in diagnosis and treatment. The deep neural network called
DeepLabV3 is used to detect the polyps in colonoscopy images.The model is examined with the
CVC-ClinicDB dataset, is a database of frames extracted from colonoscopy videos. After
training with 267 images and testing with 345 images, we got a good performance, 98.2% mean
Intersection over Union (mIOU). Once the trained model is applied to clinical colonoscopy exam
videos, it could provide effective opinions in real time to aid the diagnosis.
